    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection Assignment</h2>
    <p>For this reflection, I had my boyfriend look over my first attempt at the Segway project. He advised that I add some kind of animation to attract the audience more. The heading for the articles "About the Bike" should be bigger to stand out more. Also to add some kind of background and not have it just be white.</p>
    <p>This course has taught me a lot of things, mostly coding. In high school, I decided not to take AP Computer Science because I didn't want a heavy work load on me during my junior and senior year. The people who took it kind of struggled and it made me happy I made that decision. I was already in PreAP courses as a frehman and sophomore and started AP courses junior year. With all the credits I had and being ahead, I didn't want to mess up my GPA. Choosing Web Design and Development as my major in college was a great choice! Although I've been struggling the last few weeks, I am still happy I stuck with it. My uncle does coding for Microsoft in Seattle and told me that coding takes a lot of pracice so that it was okay to get frustrated at times.</p>
    <p>Working on this project was definitely difficult for me because even though I was paying attention in class and remembered certain things, I still couldn't get a grasp of HTML and CSS fully. Then when this final project came along, I got stuck, badly. So I went a bad route and decided to copy and paste your code and adjust it to my specific needs and demands needed for the Segway Project. One thing that I will always get frustrated over is the simple things. The smallest mistakes can mess and ruin your entire code. The things you've shown me when fixing up my errors, annoyed me at how easy I could've fixed it. But I am happy you showed me because now I will know for next time to not make the same mistake.</p>
